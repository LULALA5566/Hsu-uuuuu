I am an undergraduate in NTUEE, hoping to improve my coding skills. Though I am short, I love to play sport. In my free time, watching movies with friends, listening to classical music, traveling, and playing the piano are my jams. With an eye to drilling my skills and learning new things, I want to be admitted in some of the departments. See you!
